    <h1>Self-driving cars will make driving safer</h1>
    <p>Many experts say that self-driving cars can be trained to be safer than human drivers. With the sensors and
        cameras monitoring and guiding, these cars can not only sense their environment but also can anticipate whatâ€™s
        coming up ahead, which humans are not capable of. They may one day make the world a safer place by eliminating
        human error and reducing the number of car crashes.</p>

            There are passive safety features such as seatbelt and airbags to mitigate the consequences of a collision,
            but the most effective way to improve its safety would be to prevent the collision altogether. Even though
            self-driving technology is in its early stages, it has the potential to remove human error from the
            equation, thus reducing accidents and fatalities.</p>
