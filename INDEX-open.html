        <h1>TECHNOLOGY IN 2050</h1>
    </div>

    <p class="p1">When we think about 2050 it seems like it is ages from now and we imagine a completely different
        world, but
        in
        reality, it is just 30 years from now and we can already know what will be possible to have by that time. We
        have a lot of environmental, social problems and let’s see how technology may solve them by 2050. Today’s
        article is about tech of the future!</p>

    <p class="p2"> Before writing this article, I did a small research and checked what industry influencers think
        about this
        topic,
        for example Mr Kurzweil, Business Insider, Forbes, etc.
        Let’s start with Ray Kurzweil – the world’s foremost futurist, authoring bestsellers like “The Age of
        Spiritual
        Machines” and “How to Create a Mind.” He’s so influential that Google hired him to lead its artificial
        intelligence efforts. He is very well known for making predictions, which are right about 86% of the time.

    <p class="p3-par">Nanobots are robots made of nanomaterials that can carry out tasks. Scientists hope to use
        nanobots in medicine to kill cancer cells, deliver drugs to target tissues, and improve vaccines. Nanobots
        are also used in research as DNA probes, cell imaging materials, and cell-specific delivery vehicles.</p>

    <p class="p5-par">Despite the crashes involving self-driving cars that have hit the headlines these years, this area
        of AI could dramatically reduce deaths and injuries on our roads. According to a report by Stanford University,
        not only will self-driving cars reduce traffic related deaths and injuries, but they could bring about changes
        in our lifestyles as well. We will have more time for ourselves.</p>
