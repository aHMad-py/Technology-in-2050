    <p class="p1">According to Business Insider, Space tourism could be feasible in 2050, but likely only for the very
        wealthy. Rocket companies like Jeff Bezo’s Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX will push the envelope with space
        travel enough that tourism will be feasible in the year 2050. For example, “someone who could afford to pay 100
        million quid could spend a week in orbit… but it would only be for rich people in 2050.” he said. “It’s not
        going to be something that’s cheap anytime soon.”</p>

    <p class="p2">On June 7, 2019, NASA announced that starting in 2020, the organization aims to start allowing private
        astronauts to go on the International Space Station, with the use of the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft and the
        Boeing Starliner spacecraft for public astronauts, which is planned to be priced at 35,000 USD per day for one
        astronaut, and an estimated 50 million USD for the ride there and back.</p>
